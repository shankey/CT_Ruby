            Palampur is a small green hill city located in Kangra Valley in Himachal Pradesh. Huge spreads of tea gardens and pine trees make it one of the most picturesque hill stations of India. It is much less commercial and less populated compared to nearby hill stations Dharamshala and Mcleodganj, and hence is perfect for a quiet and relaxing holiday in the midst of slow clad mountains and shimmering rich green flora.
