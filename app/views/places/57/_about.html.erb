One of the largest brackish lakes in Asia, Pangong Tso was made even more famous by the last scene in the movie ‘3 idiots’. It stretches between India and Tibet and is the most important attraction of Leh. A person who has visited this absolutely marvelous craftsmanship of nature will never ever forget the first sight of the azure blue waters. The fact that magnifies its beauty is that this lake changes its colour every hour, ranging from emerald green to hues of blue, that makes it seem almost magical. It is located about 170 kms from Leh. The Leh- Chang La-Lukung-Spangmik route is the best among all the available options, but make sure not to rush it and give your body enough time to adjust to the altitude.
