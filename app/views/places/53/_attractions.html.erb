One could spend some time to capture the view of the Sangam point. The colour difference in both the rivers could be observed easily mainly because of the amount of silt/mud they are carrying. The Zanskar river is a little muddy which gives it a reddish tinge while the Indus is slightly clearer and gives a greenish appearance.

                   Alchi Monastery or Alchi Gompa is a Buddhist monastery which is a part of the Alchi Chhoskhor  Temples Leh, Ladakh. Chos-khor means a monastic complex.  There are different settlements of the monasteries. This is also one of the ancient monasteries in Ladakh. Alchi is one of them and is managed by the Likir Monastery. The entry ticket holds good for visiting both the monasteries. The first entrance of the temple complex was very small but once we entered we were surprised to see a tall Buddha statue which could have dated back from the 11th or 12th century. There were old and new paintings on the wall. There was also a prayer hall where one old Buddhist monk was chanting prayers and playing a huge skull drum- A Buddhist sacred instrument.

                  The prayer wheels at Alchi Monastery are built around a small peaceful area.  The serenity one experiences at the Alchi Temple complex sitting outside with ones eyes closed is unmatched. One would hear only hear the musical drums' sounds, smell the fragrance of the incense sticks and hear the chirping of birds and sound of the Indus river flowing. It considered auspicious to turn all the prayer wheels after completing your prayers.

There is a climb up through narrow steep steps to reach upto Likir Monastery complex. They have different paintings depicting Buddhism. There seems to be a great mixture of Hindu culture in Buddhism. One could see the image of Lord Ganesha, Goddess Kali and also Lord Shiva in some of the paintings. The temple tops also have a &acirc;&#128;&#152;Gopuram&acirc;&#128;&#153; like structure in some places; some have a dragon like appearance depicting the Chinese culture. Everything seemed to be merged into one culture called Buddhism which talks about peace.

                  One of the largest brackish lakes in Asia, Pangong Tso was made even more famous by the last scene in the movie ‘3 idiots’. It stretches between India and Tibet and is the most important attraction of Leh. A person who has visited this absolutely marvellous craftsmanship of nature will never ever forget the first sight of the azure blue waters. The fact that magnifies its beauty is that this lake changes its colour every hour, ranging from emerald green to hues of blue, that makes it seem almost magical. It is located about 170 kms from Leh. The Leh- Chang La-Lukung-Spangmik route is the best among all the available options, but make sure not to rush it and give your body enough time to adjust to the altitude.
