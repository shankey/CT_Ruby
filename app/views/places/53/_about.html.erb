Lamayuru Monastry is one of the oldest monasteries in Ladakh, founded by Mahasiddhacharya Naropa. Legend says that Lamayuru used to be a lake that drew into the mountains, to accommodate for the monastery after blessings from a lama. There is a dumbfounding sense of peace that welcomes anyone entering the monastery; monks chanting prayers, the unique aroma of burning incense, and curious rituals being performed. It is located in the Kargil district, about 120 Kms north-west of Leh.
