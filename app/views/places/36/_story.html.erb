 <p class="MsoNormal">Our last bike trip was to Lonavala and Khandala and another bike trip was long overdue. Since it had been a while since Barney had been driving and getting used to his new Royal Enfield Thunderbird, we thought of covering a longer distance this time. Hence, the obvious choice was Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani (both only 20 Kms apart). Mahabaleshwar is around 250 Kms from Mumbai and the plan was to cover the distance in around 5-6 hours one way.</p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Day-1</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We got up early and packed our stuff. Since it was a bike trip, we planned on packing light - Two backpacks &ndash; one with minimal clothing and necessary toiletries, and another one with Barney&rsquo;s laptop. Since it was the first time we were covering such a long distance on the bike, it was more important to be absolutely comfortable during the ride, especially Barney since he had to ride the bike all the way. We were ready by 7 sharp and were all set to hit the road. Google Maps came to our rescue once again. The route started from Sanpada to Sion-Panvel expressway where we captured a stunning shot of the sunrise from the flyover. The wind was super chilly in the early morning hours and we both were glad we chose to wear our leather jackets for the ride.</p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">After this, we hit NH4 which took us straight to Lonavala, then Pune and eventually to Mahabaleshwar. Our first stop was Lonavala&rsquo;s Rajmachi Point (60 Kms from Mumbai) where we got a lovely view of the valley and sat at one of the small cafes and had our breakfast &ndash; chai and masala maggi. After a 30 minute break, we hit the road again and stopped next at Pune (130 Kms from Mumbai). After this the journey became much more comfortable since the chill in the air was gone, the winter sun was shining bright and the highway road was much smoother.</p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">After another short stall at the end of Pune, we went straight to Mahabaleshwar and reached our resort where we&rsquo;d planned our stay &ndash; The Brightland Resort &amp; Spa at 1:30 PM. It took us 6.5 hours to cover the complete distance but it was the most thrilling and amazing experience in a long time, especially for Barney since it was the first time he&rsquo;d ridden for so long. Our resort quite perfect in all respects &ndash; the rooms were well maintained, neat, clean and nicely furnished, the service was impeccable and most importantly, the food was great! Since it was peak season, there were many families on the property.</p><br>

<p><img class="center-align" src="../images/36/brightland cottage room.jpg"></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;We took our sweet time to freshen up after the ride and then went for lunch at the Pavillion Restaurant at the resort. A nice long and relaxing meal is all what you need after a long bath. We thought of catching up on some rest before stepping out. The plan was to sleep for two hours and then visit Mapro Gardens and Chocolate Factory on the Panchgani-Mahabaleshwar road, which is just 6 Kms from the resort. At around 7 PM, we left for the gardens and reached in less than 15 minutes. This place is definitely one of the highlights of our trip. It is the main sales outlet of all Mapro products. Mahabaleshwar is most popularly known for strawberry farming and horticulture. Mapro is one of the major producers of strawberry and other fruit based products in Mahabaleshwar and have many outlets around the place. At the main garden, they have a huge set up with colourful counters for sampling and sale of all the products including syrups, juices, crushes, jellies and many more.</p><br>

<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/36/Mapro counter.jpg"></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">They have a food court too serving delicious lip smacking snacks. We grabbed a classic cheese sandwich with finger chips and topped it with the perfect strawberry cream plus strawberry ice cream. Dinner done! Such a yum way to end the day!</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align" src="../images/36/mapro icecream.jpg"></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">We got back to the resort, ordered hot soup in our room itself and enjoyed it while watching a movie on the laptop. It was a long yet such a satisfying day!</p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Day-2</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We got up leisurely just in time for breakfast. Brightland&rsquo;s buffet breakfast was yet another major highlight. It had great variety and amazing taste. Absolutely loved the fresh strawberry yogurt, fresh fruit preserves and strawberry juice. After a sumptuous long meal, we planned to step out for sightseeing. The hotel reception helped us with a map of the place with suggestions on the places to see. We first left for Pratapgarh Fort, around 22 Kms away. Loved the ride to the fort. The route was beautiful with lovely views to give us company all along. The fresh cool morning air hitting our faces and the warm morning sun which shone bright as Barney rode through the steep escalations with ease.</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/36/enroute fort.jpg"></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">Pratapgarh Fort is beautiful construction of historical significance. Although the place was crowded with school students who&rsquo;d probably come there for a picnic, we enjoyed climbing through the 450 steps and eyeing the beautiful views from various points at the Fort. We could also get a clear and lovely view of the Konkan from the Fort. The place also has Goddess Kali Temple and a statue of Chhtrapati Shivaji at the fort.</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align" src="../images/36/Fort1.jpg"></p><br>
<p><img class="center-align" src="../images/36/Fort2.jpg"></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">After an hour or so at the fort, we planned to go back and visit Old Mahabaleshwar, which is famous for a lot of beautiful view points. Old Mahabaleshwar is around 13 Kms from the main city and took us around 40 mins to reach. We started off with visiting the Marjorie Point and then moved onto Monkey Point and Savitri Point, which has breathtaking view of the Savitri Valley and River.</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/36/savitri point.jpg"></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">Next came the Aurther&rsquo;s Seat Point where Sir Aurther used to sit and stare the river which took away his wife and his son. It was a sad yet mind-etching story. Echo Point and Tiger Spring Point are also in close vicinity.</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align" src="../images/36/aurther seat point.jpg"></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">We then rode to the Mahabaleshwar city and went straight to the market where we grabbed a late lunch at the Sizzler Place (Shreyas Hotel). Barney really wanted to go to the market and play Casino and dice games which he&rsquo;d played long back when he had visited Mahabaleshwar as a kid. The market had plenty of such shops having token/coin based video casino games. So what we lost all the money &ndash; the fun we had was unmatched! :)</p>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/36/the sizzler place.jpg"></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">We bought a wine bottle from the wine shop close by and planned on having our holiday celebration at the resort while watching a movie. We visited the Mapro Garden again and bought some interesting products after a round of sampling. One thing we absolutely loved about Mapro garden was the customer service. They never hesitate in making you sample all their products till you&rsquo;re absolutely satisfied and ready to buy something. Finally we reached the resort and ended the day with some delicious pizza we ordered in our room along with our wine and movie. Lovely end to a yet another lovely day!</p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Day-3</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This was supposed to be our last day here and we planned on spending the most part of it at Panchgani. We woke up early and checked out of the resort after breakfast. We kept our bags at the hotel reception itself and planned to visit Tapola &ndash; a place 30 Kms away from Mahabaleshwar, also known as Mini Kashmir. The route to Tapola was even more enthralling than the one to Pratapgarh. The road was narrower and had some of the most beautiful views of the valley &ndash; the beautiful deep green hills embellished with shimmering blue strip of the Koyana River below. We stopped the bike for a while there and simply stared at the gorgeous view. At such times, I always tend to recall some of my most favourite beautiful songs. And at this moment with Barney, I could recall the lyrics of a very lovely Snow Patrol song - <br /> <em>If I lay here&hellip; If I just lay here&hellip; Would you lie with me and just forget the world?</em></p><br>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/36/tapola view.jpg"></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">It took us an hour to reach Tapola. It&rsquo;s a beautiful setting with Shiv Sagar Lake in between surrounded by small islands. Even in peak season, the place wasn&rsquo;t crowded much. The place offers water sports such as boating, motor boat, scooter boat, etc. Barney and I weren&rsquo;t in a mood for boating and instead planned on chilling at one of the small cafes over tea.</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/36/lake.jpg"></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">The ride back was smooth too! After reaching Mahabaleshwar, we visited Mapro Garden one last time to have the same cheese sandwhich which we both loved so much. We even checked out the chocolate factory this time which is called Mazaana. It&rsquo;s interesting to see how they make delicious chocolates &ndash; dry fruits coated in various varieties of chocolates. The roasted almond chocolates are must tries!</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/36/chocolate factory.jpg"></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">We then went back to the hotel, picked up our stuff and left for Panchgani. We&rsquo;d booked a room at Hotel Brickland, which wasn&rsquo;t as fancy as Brightland Resort but was a clean and well maintained budget stay property. Panchgani is only 20 Kms away from Mahabaleshwar and it took us only around 30 mins to reach the hotel. We checked in, freshened up and left for Parsi Point. It&rsquo;s a beautiful view point at Panchgani which claims to be one of the windiest points of the area. Since it was already evening, fog started accumulating around the place and the point wasn&rsquo;t very clear.</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/36/parsi point.jpg"></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">We visited the Panchgani Market and picked up a few things &ndash; Barney wanted to buy gloves for his long bike ride back to Mumbai the next day since it was pretty chilly and we&rsquo;d planned to leave early morning. We also bought a few brezeers to give us company as we&rsquo;d watch our next movie on the laptop. We went back to the hotel and took dinner at their well acclaimed restaurant &ndash; Jhaffer Bhai&rsquo;s Delhi Darbar, which is very popular for its non-vegetarian food and has multiple branches across India. We ordered Chicken Biryani which actually turned out to be pretty good. The day ended with watching the movie over brezeers. Come morning, we&rsquo;ll be leaving for Mumbai. The bike adventure awaits, again!</p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Day-4</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We got up early morning and freshened up quickly. The breakfast at the hotel wasn&rsquo;t very fancy but we didn&rsquo;t even want to have anything heavy before starting our ride back to Mumbai. After a basic egg and toast breakfast, we started off at 8:30 AM from Panchgani. It was pretty chilly in the morning and Barney&rsquo;s gloved helped him stride through the first half of the way pretty quickly. The first stop we took was straightaway in Pune after covering 120 Kms where we stopped by a South Indian restaurant and took a small break. Next we hit Lonavala&rsquo;s Rajmachi Point after the sun shone bright and cool winds welcomed us as we stopped by and had our staple maggi and chai. The view was absolutely stunning with the sun shining through the deep green valley and making it look even more beautiful than how it looked early morning while going.</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/36/rajmachi.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Just two stops in total and we hit Navi Mumbai in 5 hours flat. We reached home at 1:30 PM and planned to spend our Christmas Day at home resting and chilling while watching a nice movie. Barney says it was his best holiday so far &ndash; for he rode the bike over a long distance for the very first time and because he went back and relived his childhood memories at the Mapro Garden and just for the overall feel of the place. I&rsquo;d say, I just added this trip to my list of favourite trips for each and every trip with Barney has something unique and beautiful about it. And this time around, it was the deep green hills, the perfect blue skies, the fragrant cool air and everything else that I got sitting at the back while Barney rode a total of 700 Kms on the bike.</p>
<p>In one word &ndash; Beautiful! :)</p>
