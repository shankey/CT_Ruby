One of the major highlights of the Leh, Ladakh trip is Khardung La, a mountain pass that acts as the gateway to Shyok and Nubra valleys.  Khardung La is widely popularised as the highest vehicle-accessible pass in the world, which may not be factually right, but the fact that it is indeed located at an altitude of 5,359m is not any less impressive. The pass also has a lot of historical importance: about 10,000 camels and horses used to take the route annually and during World War II, war materials were attempted to be transferred to China through Khardung La.
