            Lansdowne is one of the quietest and non-commercial hill stations of India located in Uttarakhand. It is mainly visited by people from nearby cities who drive down to the place for a short weekend getaway. Lansdowne got its name from Lord Lansdowne who was the Viceroy of India during the British rule. Itâs a small pretty town with amazing view of the Shivalik Hills.
