A lot has been said about the beauty of Kashmir. And when it comes to Kashmir, Srinagar comes number one on the list. Winter Capital of the state lying across the banks of river Jhelum , Srinagar is popular not only for its perfect romantic weather but also the whole environment and setting for a lovely dream-like vacation for couples. From picturesque snow-capped mountains, beautiful Dal Lake, lovely flowers of all shades and colours at the Mughal Gardens to ever-so-romantic and cozy shikaras lazily floating in the lake â€“ everything that Srinagar has to offer is never short of mesmerizingly beautiful.
