Munnar is the lush green gem of Kerala, famous worldwide for its beautiful tea plantations. But there is certainly much more to Munnar than the popular tea plantations. It is a place to go if you want to escape into a peaceful hideaway far from the city. You’ll be welcomed by cool comfortable climate, beautiful sceneries, narrow pebbled streams, countless waterfalls, random sightings of elephant herds and hills that remind you of ‘Sound Of Music’. It is the best place to relax your eyes; such is the amount of green around. The whole of Munnar is a visual treat, ideal for leisure travellers as well as weekenders.
