 <p>Me any my boyfriend took a trip to Berlin in January 2016. the weather was quite normal for the season, around -2degrees Celsius. We wnt on a weekendtrip, so we were there for just 4days but managed to explore a lot of things in Berlin. There aren't so many tourists in Berlin, in January which I thought was quite nice. We had our hotel close to the Zoologische Garetn, the Zoo basically and is an easy acess point with train, buses and subways. We walked most of the day and just took the subway our train back to the hotel. I can only imagine how beautiful the Tiergarten are during the summer. All the trees and plant were basically dead in January (surprisingly) but you could still see the beauty in it. We walked to visit the Siegess&auml;ule and if you look closely in the roundabout you can see that there are four gray houses around the rounabout. If you have 3Euros and the strength of a ninja you can take the stairs to the top of Siegess&auml;ule. The entry to the tower is through those gray houses and creates a safe passage for people to walk without getting hit by a car to the middle of the roundabout where the tower is. The view is quite specacular, even if it's foggy outside which it was the day we visited. But yes, there are quite a lot of stairs so be prepared for that. There aren't an elevator available for all I saw. We then walked along the road too see the Brandenburger Tor, old parliament building and the Holocaust monument. The old parliament is a very, very large building and you start to wonder if Hitler had a complex with something. A lot of the buildings and monuments that hitler build are extremely big and make you feel quite small. Brandenburger Tor has some interesting history to it but you should visit it after the sun sets. The lights really bring out the best of it. The Holocaust monument was very interesting. There are a lot of big blocks and narrow paths through it to smbolise the feeling of always being watched. If there are a lot of people walking around there then you understand the meaning of it, you never know who's or what's around the corner. Just a few blocks from the Holocaust monument is the Fuhrers bunker, Hitler for those of you who don't know German so well. Nothing really to see, just &nbsp;a sign since they've builed a parking lot on top of it. Just down that road you'll also be able to fina Mall of Berlin, a big shopping place which is closed on Sundays like everything else in Germany. We also visited Alexanderplatz and saw the big tower Fehrnsehturm. You can go up there for 13euro (can't bring any travel bags, backpack ok) and see the spectacular view, there's also a restaurant where you can dine if you have the money for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're in for shopping I would recommend Mall of Berlin or The Arkaden in Potsdamer Platz, you'll have enought to shop for days if the weather would be terrible. Otherwise Berlin is a quite nice city to walk around in, don't miss out on the beer. We had one with dinner everyday and didn't get one beer we disliked. Thumbs up! &nbsp;You also don't want to miss out Checkpoint Charlie or what's left of the Berlin wall on the same street. There's a piece of the Berling wall saved on some special places around Berlin and one of them is close to Checkpoint Charlie. Next to the Wall there's also a free topographic museum for those who are interested or just cold.</p>
<p>Besides old sightseeing places from WW2 there aren't a lot of things to do in Berlin. Madame Tussauds, the restaurant where you dine in darkness, small shop called Absint Depot or Charlottenurg castle. The Absint Depot is quite a special boutiqe and if you can't handle smoking indoors, you might want to skip that one. But it's worth a trip! Charlottenburg castle wasn't so much to see, we never went inside though. A waitress gave us a tip to take the subway to Zitadelle and then walk to se an old fortress. The fortress Zitadelle was bigger than we were prepared to and if we'd known we probably would have gone there earlier during the day. It's an old fortres from like the 1400 Century I think and was quite nice. The staff there was really friendly and gave us a student discout even though only I was a student and in Sweden.</p>
<p>But dear readers, if you want to get your hands on the best cheeseburger in Berlin. Go to the restaurant called Ribs &amp; more close to the Zoologische Garten. Not expensive and easily the best cheeseburger I've had. Very friendly and serviceminded staff as well. And if you're searching for a good dark beer, go search for K&ouml;nig Ludwig. You will not be disappointed!</p>
