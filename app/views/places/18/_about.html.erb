            Lonavala and Khandala are both beautiful hill stations around 5 Km from each other, located between Mumbai and Pune. Owing to close proximity from the two busy cities, both are popular weekend getaways, especially in Monsoons and winters. While Lonavala is home to many caves such as Karla, Bhaja and Bedsa in and around the town, Khandala is mainly popular for hiking and trekking. Both the hill stations are known for their beautiful green hills, amazing view-points, deep valleys with waterfalls and the soothing calmness in the air.
