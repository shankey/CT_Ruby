 <p>I was always longing to go to Bombay after reading and hearing so much about a Delhite being in Bombay (Grade 9 inter school competition trip doesn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t count). And since he hailed from the city, it was the perfect reason for a visit now.</p>
<br>
            <p>And so it was planned under the garb of a work trip every time but with the real agenda of spending time together and discovering Bombay (long distance is tough you see, sigh). Of course there was a checklist and we still have it; we try to cross as much as possible with each of my Mumbai trips now (Yes, I do visit often). We have done a lot of things which even he hadn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t done before having lived in the city for so long! So this is an amalgamation of us discovering Bombay and the best of our moments. Read on&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;</p>
<br>

            <p>For starters, I love the name Bombay&acirc;&#128;&#138;- the name itself has a vintage charm and makes you go back in time (no, don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t imagine those black and white movies). And he would make it a point to call it out and say Mumbai, not for being righteous but for the fear of being overheard by locals (read Shiv Sena). All those noob to the distinction&acirc;&#128;&#138;- the city has been named after the patron deity Mumbaidevi, and has always been referred as &acirc;&#128;&#156;Mumbai&acirc;&#128;&#157; by locals with Bombay believed to being the colonial corrupted version of it. In 1995, officially Bombay became Mumbai. Nevertheless, I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m yet to learn to call it Mumbai.</p>

            <p>Prithvi Theatre was the top one on my list, so we booked a convenient time after work hours for our first live show together. The show was &acirc;&#128;&#156;Madbeth&acirc;&#128;&#157;, a one hour and one-man effort. While sipping the Irish coffee at the Prithvi Caf&Atilde;&copy;, we both wondered how this guy will pull off a show all by himself for an hour (Don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t miss the coffee, all you coffee lovers). We realized it was too late and entry to the theatre had begun already, so we rushed to join the queue to get good seats. We enjoyed the play thoroughly often times rolling over each other laughing. It was tragic yet humorous, and the improvisations gave a new angle each time to what was an attempted satire on Macbeth. The protagonist often referred to his pranks in the play as &acirc;&#128;&#156;premiere&acirc;&#128;&#157; in a certain funny tone, and it has since then become our internal joke each time we attempt a prank.</p>

<p>Stand-up is his thing and he would even love to do it on stage rather than just watching it. So we planned to catch up on a stand-up show. Bombay has a pretty strong comedy scene, I gathered. The show was packed, no doubt as he had chosen a day when they had the best performers in the city&acirc;&#128;&#138;- Gursimran Khamba (now with AIB), Neeti Palta, Daniel Fernandez and a few open mics. This was a two-hour show at Canvas Laugh Club, Palladium Mall, Lower Parel. We settled in with our drinks and laughed on. Those were the days when stand-up was new to India (or you can say, to me). He could see I was getting worked up on one or the other racist or fascist jokes they were cracking (which in my defense were a bit extreme) - he held my hand each of those times and laughed even harder. We were in this wonderful process of discovering each other&acirc;&#128;&#153;s quirks &acirc;&#128;&#147; his hearty laugh on each of those boundless jokes and at the same time the uncomfortable look on my face.</p>

            <p>Both of us love the seaside. How can anyone be in Bombay and not love the seaside? Although, I would admit all these beachside boulevards have over enthusiastic couples and Indian audience is yet to get comfortable with all this (hence the moral policing). Nevertheless, we all love the boulevards (and love to get uncomfortable, I think). Bandstand is different from Marine Drive and Juhu beach. It comes across as the ocean behind your house with famous celeb bungalows all across. It reminded us of Charlie Sheen&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Malibu town beach-house in Two and a Half Men and we often discussed when would we have one of our own. Bandstand was often our post dinner ritual. We used to go there for a walk. We usually would take a break to sit, sip coffee and chat and then walk again. Bandstand has a somewhat philosophical vibe to it. We always used to ponder over deeper questions, pushing each other to go beyond the known horizons and then would continue discussing anything under the sun until we established that we both agreed to disagree (like always). At other times, we simply loved the serenity while staring at the endless sea and just cogitating without any reason, letting thousands of thoughts cross our minds.</p>

<br>
<p>Juhu is another famous spot although a clich&Atilde;&copy;d one. We visited it many a times. As for Juhu Chaupati, well, it never sleeps, really! It was difficult, however, to take a nice clean and calm walk on the beach. We were looking for a clean stretch each time without bumping into dubious dealers if we go too far from the main area. Our friends had particularly pushed us to visit it again for the moonlight and the beautiful beachside but sadly, when we went again it was all stinky and filthy. We are still looking for that nice clean spot on the Juhu beach that we can enjoy, so it is until next time!</p>
<br>            
<p>The next day, I had an early morning flight to catch to work and we just had a few hours to spend together. So we decided to go to Marine Drive. It was the end of a long weekend and  was midnight already but Marine Drive was as lively as it would be at any other time during the day. It was bustling with hawkers&acirc;&#128;&#138;- chai walas, coffee walas, candies, ice cream stands and most of all&acirc;&#128;&#138;&acirc;&#128;&#148;&acirc;&#128;&#138;tons of families, college students, groups of friends and couples. All these people were brought together by their simple love for the cool sea breeze which just wouldn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t stop! It was indeed the perfect place for a conversation. And we had a lot of catching up to do &acirc;&#128;&#147; starting from sharing our school to college stories to discussing the latest movie we saw and the Chinese food we just had. I was a little cautious as moral policing is quite pervasive in Bombay. So we maintained our distance and took a walk to the other side after every few minutes.</p>

<p>Time passed quickly and hours seemed like minutes before it was already time for my flight and he dropped me to the airport. With too much caffeine in my system (thanks to the wonderful coffee by the hawkers at Marine drive), I was sure shot to think about him in plane and screw up my day at work.</p>
<br>
            <p>We love Bombay &acirc;&#128;&#147; the city never sleeps and has an amazing night life and a safe one (that&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a treasure for a Delhiite). Next on our list we have Bandra Fort, Carter Road, finding the clean stretch on Juhu Beach, and more clich&Atilde;&copy;s like Water Kingdom, Gateway of India, shopping on Linking road, Colaba, a dozen other eating joints! </p>
