It may not be a perfect holiday destination. But for people who have stayed here long enough would understand what the Mumbai feel does to someone. Yes, it's crowded and in fact dirty, but it has a beautiful vintage charm and a distinctive arty feel, which no other India city has. Yes, might seem oxymoronic, because it really is. Even though the city is crowded with people, there are things there that have a magnetic pull and would make any couple overwhelmed in romance. Amazing places to eat out, Sea link road, the lively Juhu beach, rich culture of theatre and love for Bollywood, historical monuments and of course the Marine Drive. The city has a lot to offer - so couples, do not underestimate aamchi Mumbai! :)
