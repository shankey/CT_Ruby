            Kanhaâs enthralling beauty is known to have inspired Rudyard Kipling and featured as the backdrop of the famous âThe Jungle Bookâ. Sprawling over 2,000 square kilometres (940 sq km of core zone and 1,067 sq km of buffer zone) and home to nearly 98 tigers, it is one of the few forests to be blessed with lush vegetation through the year (unlike the dry deciduous forests of Ranthambore). The winding earthy mud trails of the verdant forest are lined by the fragrant sal and bamboo trees which make up over 65% of the landscape. The rest comprises vast golden grass meadows, swamp lakes (Tals) and the occasional streams â the cool paths of which make for the tigerâs favourite hangout spot in the summer.
