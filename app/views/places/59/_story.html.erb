 <p>Me and my boyfriend visited Cyprus last year, 2015 in the end of August. The weather was very good, loads of sun and quite warm. the temperature was around 30-35degrees Celsius everyday. We had our hotel in Larnaca close to the beach called Phinikoudes. Our hotel was really great and we had about 100m down to the beach. We did some trips across Cyprus in order to experience the most of Cyprus. The shopping streets in Larnaca are actually just one or two streets with small shops that opens quite late (around 9am) and closes for siesta around 4-5pm. We didn't shop a bunch, walked around just to see the town. Laranaca is a quite old city but it buzzes with life and people. The people on Cyprus are very warm and welcoming, but you notice if you are a woman as myself that the people always adress the man first. Example when we were ordering dinner they always asked my boyfriend and he then turned to me asking what I wanted. The people are very nice, this was perhaps the worst part about them so it's easy to get over it. I don't know some people might enjoy it more than me haha.</p>
<p>Anyways, we did one bigger trip to Troodos (the mountains) to hike down the trail E4 (I think). We went by a touristbus and stopped on our way up at a small village to have som traditional Cypriotic breakfast. Just some slices of ham, chees and a sandwich without butter. Strange but interesting. We then continued our journey towards E4. The trail we hiked wasn't long just about 2km downhill with many stairs and steps so nothing for anyone with kneeproblems really. It was a bit cooler on the mountain, about 25C which was pretty nice. About the same as a warm Swedish summer so we enjoyed it. The nature was quite beautiful, reminded quite a lot of the Scandinavian forests except for the waterfall in the end. the water was supercold and the waterfall itself wasn't so big but enjoyable. My advise to you is to take the car, bus or whatever to the top and hike down unless your body is in great shape and you're in for a exercise for your legs and butt. We didn't see any animals except for some birds and fishes in the stream. At the end of this particular hike is a restaurant with its own fish culture. I didn't try the fish but herd quite some good things about it, I had meat and it was really wonderful. If you find this place, you're in for a treat. But the best part of this trip was when the bus stopped in a small wine village called Omodos. If you get the chance to go there, I strongly recommend that you'll want to have some more time than just one hour. We really wished we had some more time. The people were really friendly and had small shops selling all kinds of thins from jewellery, wine, ice cream and all sorts of hand made things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also took the bus to Nissi Beach from Larnaca one day. Nissi Beach is locaed just outside of Ayia Napa which is known for a place where the youths go to party. The beach was quite crowded but it didn't bother us because the water was so amazingly clear. Turquoise and so clear you could see your whole foot even with water up to your chin!! Really recommend everyone to do some snorkeling. There is a small peninsula or almost and island, it's perfect to snorkel around it and enjoy the sealife. My boyfriend did it, he was nervour at first since he isn't the best of swimmers but the water has so much salt in it that it didn't bother him. He was floating quite well. the beach is really recommended and they have showers, bathrooms and restaurants on the beach so it's no problem with that. the bus stops just 100m from where you walk down to the beach between the hotels. the bus ticket in Cyprus were really cheap, between 1,50-3Euro depending on which bus you'd take.</p>
<p>We also wanted to visit Fig Tree Bay or Protaras as it is called because it was recommended by some of our friends. But listen up, if you're like me and don't like spots where there are a ton of tourists packed together and a "hotel village" build around the beach then you should stay away. I mean it, it is not worth it even though the water is nice. Follow our example instead for some amazing adventure. We saw Protaras and pretty much turned around after 15min. We got the tip from a waitress that we should definitely not miss visiting Cape Greco or Cavo Greco. This is the place you should go to, needs some planning or effort but it is worth it. Take the bus from Protaras, it's only like 5-10min away. But when you get off the bus, there are no restaurants, no bathrooms, no hotels. Nothing, just you and the nature. I recommend walking to Cape Greco by Aphrodities Path, but make sure you don't have some flip-flops on because the trail is a bit uneven and rocky. You're going to want to have some sneakers or anything besides flip-flops. My boyfriend learned this the hard way. The traila is about 3km long. You're getting close when you see some caves on your right side, check them out they're pretty cool as well! Oh right, the trail/path is full of lizards but they don't trouble you. They'll get out of your way before you think thay are in your way. Anyway, walk past the parking lot down where you're close to the water and walk maybe 50m. There you go, clear water and not a tourist in sight. If you have a better map then us then there's suppose to be some sea caves nearby but we missed them. It's definitely worth the small trip and effort, renting a car or something like that is recommended beacuse you can drive there by road. Just make sure you rent a car that isn't superlow beacuse there are some rocks in the "street".</p>
<p>We didn't go to Limassol but were told that the city is quite beautiful and old, worth a visit the next time we'll go to Cyprus!</p>
