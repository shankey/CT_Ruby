Tso Moriri is the largest lake in the Ladakh region, this beautiful lake is famous for its flora and fauna. Adjacent to it is the quaint village of Korzok, made famous by its monastery. The beautiful surroundings of the lake gives it a breathtakingly romantic feel, but being at a staggering altitude of 4595 meters, extreme care should be practiced while visiting. It is at a distance of about 240 km from Leh. There are 3 ways to reach Tso Morriri. The first method is to travel directly from Leh. Leh-Karu-Chumathang-Mahi-Korzok route is the best among the available options. Alternatively, if you are travelling from Pangong Tso, take the Spangmik-Kakstet-Chusul-Loma-Nyoma-Mahe-Tso Morriri route which is one of the most beautiful drives in the whole Ladakh region. It is about 250 kms. If you are a non-Indian, you might have to take a different route, Spangmik-Chang La-Kumdok- Chumathang- Mahe- Korzok which is about 340 kms long. Make sure you have enough fuel for the journey before starting out.
