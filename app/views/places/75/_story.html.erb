 <p class="MsoNormal">It had been long since Barney and I visited a hill station up in the north. We visited Mahabaleshwar in December and it was awesome but we had fond memories of our trip to Dalhousie and Khajjiar long back and we thought of rewinding the time again and visiting the beautiful mountains of Himachal.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was my birthday in February and that too the actual one (I&rsquo;m a leap year kid and this time around February actually witnessed a 29<sup>th</sup> in the calendar). We thought of making it special and visiting a hill station. Since Barney was coming from Mumbai, we thought we would go to a place which has an airport so that we could take a flight to that place directly rather than hopping onto a bus or train from Delhi. Hence, one of the best options we agreed on was Dharamshala.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nestled in the beautiful valleys of Kangra, is this quaint and peaceful place. Dharamshala and Mcleodganj are connected and only 6 Kms apart and we thought we could make the most of the trip by visiting both the places over a 3 day trip.</p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Day-1:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We took an early morning flight. Barney took a connecting flight from Mumbai-Delhi-Dharamshala. I hopped onto the same flight from Delhi. It is always a treat to see him after long. My eyes scanned the crowed fast as I saw him at the Delhi domestic airport. From there we boarded the mini-flight to Dharamshala together which took less than an hour to reach. The airport doesn&rsquo;t have many official taxi options hence you would be left with few options when you move out of the airport. Barney negotiated with a taxi guy who agreed to charge 800 bucks to drop us at our Mcleodganj hotel.</p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">The route to Mcleodganj from the airport was serene and peaceful &ndash; rocky terrain on one side and deep valleys with rich green trees on the other. &nbsp;It took us around us around an hour to reach Mcledoganj. We had pre-booked the &ldquo;Master Bedroom&rdquo; at a hotel which was sort of a home-stay and not the usual commercial hotels. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s called Horizon Villa South and was located at a quiet corner, away from the noise of the market. We checked in around early afternoon and the room turned out to be exactly as we expected. It was a reasonably spacious room and appeared warm and cosy unlike the typical hotel rooms with clich&eacute;d furniture and arrangements. This room also had a big French window overlooking the balcony where one could see the lovely view of the mountains.</p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">We were starving since we didn&rsquo;t even have proper breakfast in the morning. There were two helpers who cooked fresh food on order. We quickly placed an order for simple daal, rice, chapatis with paneer. The food took some time but it was worth the wait. It was a simple home-cooked meal with less oil and spices. After a delightful meal, we just sat on the comfy couch enjoying Sherlock Holmes TV series which Barney played on his laptop, and thought of napping for an hour or two. What better than forgetting the mundane city life, being together in a beautiful cosy room and sleeping after a good meal!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We woke up late in the evening and thought of going out for dinner at one of the restaurants at the main Mcleodganj Square. The market was a 15 minute walk from our hotel. It became quite chilly at night and enjoyed strolling through the market to reach the Square. We planned to eat at a McLlo&rsquo;s which is a multi-cuisine caf&eacute; with a bar. We weren&rsquo;t really hungry and went ahead</p> <br><p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="http://snapdeal-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1471723968/mcllos_tkmvq3.jpg"></p><br> 

<p class="MsoNormal">After a quick dinner, we walked back to our hotel amidst the chilly breeze, staring thousands of stars which appeared in the sky, which sadly never appear from the cities we live in!</p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Day-2:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We woke up early and planned to cover Mcleodganj the whole day. There were a few points which we&rsquo;d read about and planned to visit the same. One of the major highlights of the day was the kick-ass beginning &ndash; the breakfast! We got the eggs, omelettes and parathas made and asked the cook to serve it outside at the balcony. We sat across the table overlooking the beautiful morning mountains with sweet chill in the air. It was amazing to enjoy a leisurely breakfast with Barney that morning. We were sipping hot ginger tea while Barney was in his best moods joking around and sharing stories.</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/75/balcony.jpg"></p><br> 

<p class="MsoNormal">We got ready and left for one of the most visited attractions of the place &ndash; The Dalai Lama Temple, which was just a 5 minute walk from our hotel. This temple is the place where Dalai Lama resides when he not away on his preaching tours. The complex is a humble, peaceful and beautiful place to visit and exudes extremely positive vibes. We went inside the temple pray area and spent some time just walking through the complex, rotating prayer wheels and discussing how simplistic and beautiful these places are for monks to reside and practice meditation.</p><br>

<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/75/Prayer wheels.jpg"></p><br> 

<p class="MsoNormal">After this, we left for the market. We thought of getting a bike/scooty on rent to visit the places around since that seemed to be the best option. There are multiple shops providing two-wheelers on rent so finding one should not be an issue at all. We took an Activa on rent for 2 days from one of the shops and negotiated hard for the price.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First, we left for Bhagsu Waterfalls. It&rsquo;s around 5 Kms from the main Mcledoganj square and took us around 20 minutes to reach on Activa. After parking the scooty, we walked to the waterfalls area which took us another 15-20 minutes. The walk is slightly elevated; however, the lovely weather didn&rsquo;t make it seem like much of an effort. The air smelt sweet with slight fog which was getting perfectly complimented by mild sun rays shining upon the sparking water gushing from the top to a small pond like structure. There were a few people dipping their feet in the water.</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align" src="../images/75/Bagsu Falls.jpg"></p><br> 

<p class="MsoNormal">Barney &amp; I chose to sit at a small kiosk across the fall and have tea instead. Taking off the snug shoes and socks seemed too much effort. We sat there for a while in fact discussing Coupletrips itself and how we could take it forward. We got a few couply pictures clicked there and went back to Mcleodganj square for lunch.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We scrolled through TripAdvisor for some restaurant suggestions and magically found this awesome place called Indique in the market area itself. Since Barney wanted to have Indian, this place seemed like the best option for its food and its ambiance as well! There was a nice rooftop area with a lovely view of the mountains where we chose to sit. The mind sun upon us seemed just perfect for the setting.</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/75/Indique.jpg"></p><br> 

<p class="MsoNormal">We ordered Lemon Coriander soup, chicken and chapatis. The food was great! After a good meal, we decided to visit St. John&rsquo;s church which was just a 5 minute ride from the main square. The lovely gothic building catches attention and its beauty is further amplified with the lovely stretch of green grass and trees surrounding the church.</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/75/St Johns.jpg"></p><br> 

<p class="MsoNormal">By the time we got free from the church, it was about to be around 5 PM. We thought of visiting Naddi, which is another 4-5 Kms away from the main square. Barney rode across the elevated stretches while I sat that the back admiring the beautiful view and deep-inhaling the fresh mountain air. We stopped at the Dal Lake which came mid-way. The lake is however, not as pretty as the name sounds! But of course, the lovely weather makes even an average place seem awesome.</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/75/Dal Lake.jpg"></p><br> 

<p class="MsoNormal">We reached Naddi in time for the sun-set but our view was blocked by dense clouds and fog. How can a hill-station-trip be complete without savouring an unbeatable combination of mountains, maggi and chai? We sat by a small kiosk and had the maggi and ginger tea. We weren&rsquo;t lucky enough to get a very good view of the sunset, but nevertheless, we had a great time like we always do and left back for the hotel.</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/75/Naddi Sunset View.jpg"></p><br> 

<p class="MsoNormal">We went back to the hotel and decided to eat cosily at the room itself snuggled in the blankets together and watching Sherlock Holmes. We had a nice homely meal and went off to sleep like babies :) Day well spent!</p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Day-3:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This day was supposed to &ldquo;Dharamshala&rdquo; day since the previous day we covered Mcledoganj. After a lovely breakfast in the exact same setting, we decided to first visit the tea gardens at Dharamshala. We took around an hour and a half to reach Dharamshala on the scooty. Google Maps came to our rescue again mainly with a little help from the locals whom we used to ask about the routes along the way. We reached tea gardens and decided to park the scooty around the corner. There&rsquo;s a huge stretch of lovely gardens with plats glistening in different shades of green. The hills in the background offer a perfect picturesque view which we felt like admiring all day long!</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/75/Daharamshala tea gardens - Copy.jpg"></p><br> 
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/75/Dharamshala view.jpg"></p><br> 

<p class="MsoNormal">We clicked a few pictures and strolled there for a while before heading to the famous Dharamshala cricket ground, which unfortunately turned to be closed when we reached there for the upcoming India-Pakistan match the following week.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was lunch time and we were hungry. We planned to stop for lunch at one of restaurants mid-way called R-square. After a long lunch along with watching 3 idiots playing on TV at the restaurant, we left for Norbulingka Institute. It&rsquo;s a place created for preserving and practicing Tibetan art and crafts. It&rsquo;s a beautiful place construed beautifully with a small temple Buddhist temple, a museum with Tibetan history, prayer wheels, shopping section (which is super expensive, btw) and a cute small with outdoor seating. We went to the temple, roamed around the institute and sat at the caf&eacute; for a while.</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="http://snapdeal-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1471724579/Norbulinkga_interrior_llewi5.jpg"></p><br> 

<p class="MsoNormal">Our next top was Gyuto Monastery, a little further away from Nornulikgka. We parked our scooty outside and walked to the entry gate only to witness a beautiful building in red and gold which stood in front of a lovely background with light-blue mountains. The trees and flowers at the monastery made it look even more beautiful.</p><br>
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/75/Gyutu.jpg"></p><br> 
<p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/75/Gyutu interrior.jpg"></p><br> 

<p class="MsoNormal">We walked inside the Buddhist temple and saw atleast 40 monks meditating inside, while some were busy cleaning and some reading. It&rsquo;s a place that accommodates hundreds of Buddhist monks who go there to study, meditate and lead a life of sheer simplicity and peace. That place had a special positive aura to it altogether.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We stayed there for a bit before leaving back to Mcleodganj to our hotel. Little did I know that Barney would have planned sweet little surprises for me all through. It was my birthday the next day and Barney gave me some very special things with a lovely note attached to each of them with the meaning of the gift. Each of them was well thought of and very close to my heart. These things in him make my heart melt like wax! All I know it, I can&rsquo;t stop loving him more with each passing day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Next day were our flights &ndash; mine to Delhi and his to Mumbai. We woke up early and left for Dharamshala airport after returning the rented Activa. We watched some more Sherlock Holmes in the plane and the airport. Yet another beautiful trip came to an end with us parting thereafter, with a hope of meeting again soon!</p>
