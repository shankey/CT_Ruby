 <p>Since this was a secret trip and our families don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t know about it, I'm changing names here for privacy so that our tech savvy parents don't come running after us with bullets!I got up late but was extremely excited! Finally I&acirc;&#128;&#153;d be going for a Holiday! 
I dusted my backpack and quickly packed my tees and jeans (and also my shorts, so that I could be off to Goa in case Manali got cancelled). I had an extended shower, watered my lilies in my balcony, prayed they don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t die, and after a few clicks went off. Manali, here I come!
</p>
<br>
                          <p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/Charles_Manali_Images/Manali%20Cover.jpg"></p>
<br>
            <p>I stopped for lunch @ Ruby's (God bless America for burgers :)
Took metro to Pragati Maidan, and went to Bal Bhawan, from whre the bus was to depart. I found out that the departure was shifted to some place near Vidhan Sabha Metro Station. I didn't feel like taking the metro for the weather was beautiful that day. I took a cycle rickshaw for New Delhi Station instead.</p>
<br>
            <p>I enjoyed the sights and sounds of Dilli, and Khan chacha's comments on how it had changed through all these years. When I reached the boarding point, it started to drizzle. Since I had reached early, I had to wait and was eventually soaked up like water on sand!</p>
<br>
            <p>Finally the bus came and the door opened. I took my seat by the window, and gazed outside at the beautiful weather. I had myself really comfortable with my earphones on when I noticed someone rushing through the door, followed who looked like her Mom &amp; Dad.</p>
            <p> She was looking side by side for the seat number inquisitively. Instantly, she pointed out towards me. Her Mom &amp; Dad settled by the seat opposite mine. Having forcefully stuffed her backpack on the overhead shelf, she eventually sat down with a thud. She spoke in "some language" to her dad and after a lot of hustle-bustle, adjusted herself to her seat. Finally, I thought she settled down. Droplets were dripping from her blonde hair. I took a moment to take a quick glance at her and realized how beautiful she looked!</p>
            <p>She threw open her shoes, wiped her wet hair and then tied them into a ponytail... She took off her jumper long necks and then turned around to face me She said <i>"Hi! Since we will be along for the next 12 hours... I'm Christina..."</i></p>
<br>
            <p>That's when I really looked at her eye to eye. She was mesmerizingly beautiful!
After sharing a brief intro, she asked me, "What are u listening to?" and that is when we started to chat about music...how I had a crush on Christina Aguilera as a kid... etc.... etc...
Her parents too settled. She introduced her Dad Nicholas &amp; Mom and began to talk again. She seemed to be really zestful.</p>
            <p>Within next few minutes, I came to know she was from France. I told her about Calcutta. She was a student of literature. I simply loved the way she spoke English because sounded really sweet :)</p>
<br>
            <p>I didn't realize bus was on the way already and made a quick phone call to Mom, and said "I'll be back :)"
We reclined our seats, turned towards each other and started chatting endlessly about random topics...We got to know each other better.</p>
<br>
            <p>At night, the scenes outside became even more beautiful. The huge powerful Volvo headlights led our way to what for me was paradise! To her Israeli dad, it was a break away from the excessive heat. And for her French mom, it was a time to spend some quality family time together. I must say I enjoyed the company thoroughly!</p>
<br>
            <p>Her dad forced her to take a Kashmiri Shawl... she said something which sounded like "Abba #######". I guessed, she didn't want it seeing the way she threw it back.
                Her Hebrew sounded even sweeter, even though I understood none of it :)</p>
<br>
            <p>As time passed on and streams of far-away lights shone inside, she looked even more beautiful, the moon was shining bright on her face. I told her, "You look like an angel". She just laughed and poked me.
I told her about my plans for Manali and how I had planned for a break away. She and her family were on a month's tour. They had already visited Ladhak.</p>
            <p><i>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Oh!! Ladakh!!! I really want to go there!&acirc;&#128;&#157;</i> I exclaimed! 
                They were planning to visit Andaman Islands after this.</p>
<br>
            <p>By the time our bus stopped for dinner, somewhere in Haryana, we felt we had known each other since ages since we&acirc;&#128;&#153;d been chatting for a very long time. Her mom &amp; dad were already asleep... They woke up but didn't get down. I started munching on some fruits - Oranges, apples and guava. I invited her to try some Punjabi Indian Food. She gladly tagged along. Out came my camera and I started clicking pictures of the beautiful surroundings.</p>
<br>
             <img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/Charles_Manali_Images/Enroute%20at%20one%20of%20the%20restaurants.jpg"> <br><br>
            <p>She said,<i>"Hey, what about me?"</i>... I obliged.</p>
<br>
            <p>I clicked a picture of her by the roadside, resting at a tree. One by the fountain and while eating aalu paratha! I captured every spot of the Mehfil Restaurant :)
                The bus driver's honk stopped us. It was time to leave.</p>
<br>
            <p>She chatted on &amp; on. It was around 3 o'clock when she fell asleep. I watched her sleep like a cute little child all cuddled up in her seat.
Didn't know when I feel asleep. I woke up suddenly feeling really hot. The AC had stopped working for a while. The bus had stopped and we were somewhere high up in the hills. There was a mile long traffic jam. Apparently some truck broke down and due to the narrow spiralling roads, the two way traffic movement was hindered. I got down with my camera again.
I captured the beads of lights curling round the mountain layers like a beautiful necklace.
                The cool breeze was soul replenishing!</p>
<br>
            <p>Then someone came down and tucked me from behind... "Enjoying all by yourself"... We found a nice rock by the side of the mountain, got on top it. Our legs dangling in free air... looking down at what would be more than 100 feet deep gauge... but fear wasn't among the feelings we were feeling...</p>
            <p>The world seemed so simple, when she laughed. We checked in at Foursquare... tweeted <i>"Subaah hone na de...Saath khone na de...Ek duje ko hum sone na de..."</i> She asked me what it meant and I explained to her. For a while I didn't speak... she did... we gazed sometimes at the endless darkness and then sometimes crossing each other... the trucks ahead of us started moving slowly...  we got back into the bus. </p>
<br>
<p>I told her why I really wanted to escape reality and how someone who wrote my name on her hand with a knife, loved me so much and then left me alone and I wasn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t able to do anything!
She told me how her boyfriend cheated on her. Our friendship took a deeper turn.  A few hours later the driver said something loudly &acirc;&#128;&#147;
    <i>"Bus aadha ghanta rukegi.. Breakfast bathroom kar lo..."</i></p>
<br>


             <p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/Charles_Manali_Images/The%20beautiful%20valleys%20alongside.jpg"></p>
<br>
            
            <p>It started becoming cold! It was chilly and I loved it. She wrapped her shawl, and came down.
She shared some really nice and hot coffee with her Dad &amp; Mom. Mr.Talmor was a doctor.
We were 3 hours late. I wasn't complaining and neither was she. Her parents were though.
Her Mom told me about her desire to visit Kashmir... but was afraid because of terrorists... I assured them and encouraged them to visit.
</p>
            <p>We resumed our journey. This time, she folded up the middle arm rest and sat by my side... all the way watching me clicking beautiful photos through the window. The view outside was breathtakingly beautiful!</p>
                    <img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/Charles_Manali_Images/Nature%20at%20it's%20best.jpg"><br>    
<p>We reached Manali around 10 o'clock. She got down with her usual zest. When we gathered our luggage from the side of the bus, she suddenly suggested to her Dad, "Dad, why doesn't "Tito" stay with us, he's alone anyway?"</p>
            <p>I was surprised and even her parents were shocked. They both uttered something in French, after which her dad asked "Would u mind?" I don't know why but I spontaneously agreed!</p>
            <p>We checked into a beautiful four bedroom hotel room overlooking the Beas River... It had a small beautiful balcony with tea tables. The natural beauty was jaw dropping! </p>
            <p>She grabbed my hand and showed me that the bed by the window was hers.
I was still puzzled since I didn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t know how to describe my feeling. I had thought I was lost but being with her made me happy :)</p>
<br>
            
            <p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/Charles_Manali_Images/Beas%20River.jpg"></p>
<br>
            
<p>I had a quick shower and then was off with her parents for lunch. We enjoyed some tasty Momos, peas &amp; potato curry &amp; Stuffed Nan. We all ate like super hungry people :D
We decided to go for nearby sight-seeing. We trekked all the way up to Hadimba temple and felt really light
</p>
<br>
             <img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/Charles_Manali_Images/Hadimba%20Temple.jpg"><br><br>
<p>She looked stunning. Her skin had become even pinker under the sun :) After the temple, we enjoyed seeing the arts museum together.</p>
            <p>Then came the rabbit picture clicking time! I took a photo with a rabbit who she was damn scared of. She tried to get a shot of herself but she wasn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t ready to go near the rabbit at all. The rabbit also hopped around cutely whenever she came near. Finally we took our first picture together wherein I was hugging the rabbit, and she was holding my arm :P</p>
            <p>I teased her all the way down which made her fume with anger!</p>
<br>
 <img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/Charles_Manali_Images/Manali%20Museum.jpg"><br><br>
            <p>We then went to a really popular German Bakery. The trek had made us really hungry.
We enjoyed really tasty American Pie with some soothing live Music. Her Mom &amp; Dad broke started dancing and she jumped in. I hesitantly did my ball dance moves on Carribean Music!</p>
<br>
            <p>We were then off to Vashist Temple &amp; Hot Springs.
The priest told us the water was very hot. She didn't listen and opened the tap with full force. Hot sulphuric water poured down her delicate feet. She screamed and jumped. The kids around her were all laughing. Thankfully, she was ok and didn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t herself much.</p>
<br>
            <p>We then tried on a separate pool mixed with cold water. The night we spent strolling down Mall road... We went to bed early... next day we were leaving for Rohtang Pass. As the day ended and we fell asleep, we kind of grew very fond of each other!</p>
<br>
            <p><b>Day-2</b></p>
<br>
            <p>She woke up early and packed her warm clothes.
We took a small mini-van to Rohtang Pass. We were joined by two other families. 
One of them, a sikh and his wife, both were quite old. They asked, "Have you come for your honeymoon?"</p>
            <p>When I told her what the sikh uncle asked, she curled her arms round mine and said "Yes!"</p>
<br>
            <p>After that she kept on holding my hand and I felt great! She did that on every twist and turn, each time we were too close to the edge and even when we saw a track almost tumbling down the mountain.</p>
            <p>After numerous road blocks and land-slides we reached 11200ft. for a pit stop and Hot Tea :) 
We took our first inside the temple and watched all the colourful flags, with some writings on it. We were in midst of the clouds and fog running through the mountains. She instantaneously said "I like you"...
                I grabbed her hand, on her way down even though I was sure this time everyone noticed.</p>
<br>
            <img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/Charles_Manali_Images/Enroute%20Rohtang%2011,200%20Ft%20high.jpg"><br><br>
            <p>Rohtang Pass was freezing cold! We took an ATV to the top. I sat behind the driver, and she sat behind me. She grabbed me tightly as we motored our way up the Rocky Mountains. At the top, we saw a small igloo and cuddled together for a photo.</p>
            <p>On our way down, we hired a wooden sledge and came sliding down icy slope. The fun part was that there were no brakes to stop us :)
                That was truly more thrilling than any roller coaster I ever sat on.</p>
<br>
<img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/Charles_Manali_Images/ATV%20Ride.jpg"><br><br>  
            <p>Our weather suits were all wet. We came down and had some hot soupy Maggi. By the time we reached back it was around 9PM. We ordered the dinner at our room itself. It was a beautiful night. Both of us sat on the balcony holding each other the entire night.
                Her mom was worried that we might catch cold. </p>
<br>
            <p><b>Day-3</b></p>
<br>
            <p>Next morning we woke up in the balcony. This was supposed to be an Adventure Day - Paragliding, Trekking and Rope Way.
Both of us were really looking forward to it. We wore matching white shirt and denims.
We reached Solang Valley and took the beautiful Ropeway up and high into the mountains. We could see the clouds below us. That really seemed like a place where dreams met reality.</p>
<br>
            <img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/Charles_Manali_Images/Rope-way.jpg"><br><br> 
            <p>We waited hours for the fog to clear out, but it didn't. The pilot said that it was too risky for the jump since the visibility was merely 10 feet. We couldn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t take the jump but the amazing surroundings, with beautiful flowers, lovely tall trees and amazing waterfalls compensated for the same. However, we returned heartbroken.</p>
<br>
            <p><b>Day-4</b></p>
<br>
            <p>Next day, we decided to try some Apple wine after lunch, which made us feel slightly dizzy. Her parents went to Mall road for shopping and we decided to go to Manali Nature Park. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a beautiful park with lush green gardens. We hired a duck boat and paddled together. We never even realized how hours went by so quickly. In the evening, we went near the Beas River. We sat together by the beautiful river and gazed at the mountains. We took numerous photographs together!</p>
<br>
            <p>After this, we went to the mall road. She insisted on buying "bindi" which looked absolutely stunning on her. I even bought her small beaded "payal&acirc;&#128;&#157;.
She wanted to see me wearing a woollen Himachal cap, and bought me one. I bought her a beautiful yak wool shawl, which she wrapped around her waist and wore like a skirt.</p>
<br>
            <p>At night, since our trip was coming to an end, I decided to her ask where we&acirc;&#128;&#153;re headed and what the future of our equation was. After a few romantic moments, She answered in one simple statement.</p>
            <p>"Marry Me"</p>
<br>
            <p>It wasn't easy. I told her that I have been through quite a lot of rough patches in my love life. I told her that I want to grow old with the person I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll marry. However, I wasn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t ready to handle another breakup.
I was in a very confused state and did not know what to do. I called up mom for advice and she said, "Leave everything to God".</p>
<br>
            <p>The whole evening we sat by the river, hand in hand. 
While going back I told her, &acirc;&#128;&#156;14th February 2013, I will be at the Eiffel Tower, if you'll come to see me, and we feel the love between us, I'll marry you then &amp; there&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<br>
            
            <p><b>Day-5 15th August 2012 (Independence Day)</b></p>
<br>
            <p>Amazingly the French hated the British as much as us :)
This time, we went early up the Mountains to Solang Valley. The sky was clear enough this time. This is what we had been waiting for. With a huge cheer we ran off and jumped from the cliff one after the other. High above the mountains, around the trees, we swished with the gush of wind, flying free as a bird, and then landed normally.</p>
<br>
            <p>We were together all day long, and were closer than ever. Just before leaving, we visited a Tibetan Monastery. She was deep in thoughts and turned all the prayer poles. I had never seen her like that.</p>
<br>
            <img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/Charles_Manali_Images/Prayer%20Wheels%20at%20the%20Tibetan%20Monastery.jpg"><br><br>
            <p>I held her face between my palms, and said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;let our love be this strong always.&acirc;&#128;&#157; She said, Be there on the 14th, I will.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
            <p>Time was up, we had to return. I bid her a goodbye with a kiss on her forehead.
                Adieu Manali...</p>
<br>
             <img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/Charles_Manali_Images/Just%20before%20getting%20back%20from%20Manali.jpg"><br><br>
            <p>Morning came faster than we wished; I got off at Connaught Place.
Her Dad gave us a moment alone. We spoke just a little and looked at each other's watery eyes. Her Mom came by and said "Come and visit us".
                And then, we parted ways, my fingers sliding through hers till the very end.</p>
