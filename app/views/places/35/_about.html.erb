Rajasthan is one of the most colourful and vibrant states of India. When we speak of a perfect blend, Rajasthan can act as a perfect example, for it’s a perfect blend of history and modernity, of art and culture, or colour and riches, of heritage and honour, of food and festivities  and celebrations. The place has some of the most beautiful monuments in the world – every city has been touched by Kings and every pillar, nook and corner has a story to narrate. Jaipur, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer are just some of the vividly colourful cities of the state. In the current travel story, Joesef talks about his excursions to Jaipur and Jaisalmer with his partner.
