 <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>January 2016 &ndash; Goa and Scuba Diving Part I</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We both don&rsquo;t believe in special day celebrations (Life has to be celebrated everyday&hellip;No?). But since the world does, we planned a trip with a few friends around his birthday (less chances of people ditching on a birthday week than on all other weeks of the year). Hence it was birthday week in Goa and scuba diving planned for the big day.</p><br>
 <p><img class="center-align" src="../images/73/goa1.jpg"></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We have been to Goa before, but we weren&rsquo;t dating back then and were in a large group of friends. Our first Goa trip was where it all started. Anyways that&rsquo;s a story for another day. (A Goa prequel is coming your way guys &ndash; very soon)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It turned out to be a great trip on a shoestring (apart from scuba)! We stayed at Calanguate - one of the hubs for clubbing, eating, shopping and of course the beaches. Despite Calanguate being infamous for being dirty and crowded, we fortunately landed on a pretty serene and tidy section of the beach. We had booked a beach cottage (with Tivai Beach Cottages, clean but very basic amenities) which was at the most two minutes away from the ocean and beach shacks. The shacks around were pretty decent with good food. One of the shacks &ndash; Ritz Shack was our favorite and we became a regular there for those five days. It was operated by a middle aged couple and their hospitality and service were unmatchable. They made you feel at home instantly. Also, not to forget the crowd on this side of Calanguate was mostly sun bathing foreigners unlike the uncomfortable crowd you meet on some stretches of the beach. Overall this location is perfect. (yeah, a lot of free marketing just happened)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I should also mention about our friends (its three passages already, they will be pissed). So we had a lovely couple with us, our friends from work. They were like our adopted parents or you can say our Goa family. More adventurous than the two of us, but a lot more reserved as a couple &ndash; they cringed at slightest of PDA in vicinity (read us of course). We made sure we gave them enough instances to cringe away or rather run away from us. I must mention here - I was traveling with three vegetarians and teetotalers. Okay, now I know you will stop reading &ndash; What&rsquo;s Goa without booze? Right?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our itinerary apart from scuba was simple &ndash; chilling at the beach. With all four of us being so laidback, it was more of an unsaid understanding rather than the usual couple bickering on such trips. So we had pre-planned one day at Palolem beach (Palolem is in South Goa over 100kms away from Calanguate) with its pristine beaches but decided against it as soon as we saw our beach cottage and the clean stretch of Calanguate in front of us. In the interim, we also thought of Doodh Sagar Waterfall (it&rsquo;s the beautiful waterfall from the movie Chennai Express). It was 90kms away. Dropped. Same with a Wildlife Sanctuary, which was discussed briefly for two minutes. We had hired a Thar to roam around so it became very convenient for whatever (short) distances we had to travel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We landed on Saturday evening and started with Arpora Saturday Market &ndash; a very low key start to our trip. Locals and foreigners mingling on the off-beat music of the local band was more fun to watch than the shopping. We had one or two of our foot tapping moments as well even with that music!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Arambol &ndash; Russians ka Goa</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Next day we planned to explore other beaches in North Goa and Arambol was on the top of the list. We had heard about Russians fancying Arambol for some reason and wanted to know why. And so we hopped onto our Thar (Yeah, I will mention it again and again as it was freaking expensive!) sipping away the coconut waters (it becomes very hot during noon, and Arambol is over 25kms away). The Arambol beach was comparatively more dirty though the shacks more comfortable with loads of places to laze around. This beach clearly caters to non-Indian clientele &ndash; we received discriminated service and not-so-great food. The sunset was nevertheless beautiful; made so much more by the company around. We clicked the clich&eacute; silhouette against the sunset, I stepped on his feet in one of the pictures to hug, he was barely able to manage my weight! We witnessed our couple friends finally shedding their inhibitions and warming up to the perfect sunset setting with their first (public) kiss. We sculpted sand woman (the fully sculpted not meant for this blog) on Arambol beach. The evening was planned for an intimate dinner with one of friends in Goa at Estrela do Mar Resort. There was a lot of catching up to do, meeting new people and love stories to be told and retold. The resort is beautifully done with lots of great delicacies. Our next not-so budget stay will be here for sure.</p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Our Zindagi na Milegi Dobara Moment - Scuba</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We had planned scuba with Goa Aquatics - it is the most reputed one with a lot of experience (basically safest bet). The training started in Little Italy Resort&rsquo;s swimming pool with a really great coach (there was some struggle with fitting into scuba suits). Scuba is short for Self-contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus, none of us knew that, otherwise it was mostly a short school physics revision session. We were all geared up and in water to learn how to breathe through the regulator and practiced that for half an hour. Our coach also gave us three techniques after we got a hang of breathing underwater &ndash;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(i) how to release the air pressure difference through our ears by holding our nose (The Valsalva Maneuver). This had to be done for every 1 to 2 feet while descending under water.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(ii) how to release water from our head mask (in case the situation comes)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(iii) how to release water from the regulator (in case the situation comes)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We learnt about the dive site &ndash; it was a shipwreck, 1.5 hours away in boat. Back in 1950s, Captain of SS Rita was drunk (as most sea captains were at that time) and banged it on a rock. In his defense, 90% of the rock was submerged and ship spilt into two after crashing (&agrave; la Titanic). We were to see the rear of the ship called as Suzy&rsquo;s wreck which is now home to mollusks, corals, lobsters, clams, barracudas and other tropical marine life.</p><br>
 <p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/73/goa 4.jpg"></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A session in pool made us starve and we headed out straight for some carbs and coffee. It was dusk time and the caf&eacute;s around Calanguate had live singers. We danced around on the cheesiest numbers possible &ndash; that was our version of ballroom dance. Since it was the birthday eve; the excitements were running at an all-time high &ndash; so it was from Bryan Adams Cloud number nine, to Woh Chali woh chali.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We all tidied up for the Birthday bash which was to be celebrated at Fat Fish on our way to Club Cabana. Our friends had got the perfect cake and birthday trivia to spice it up. We played the usual birthday music and splashed the cake all over him, had our food and headed to Club Cabana. Club Cabana is actually a villa on a hill top beautifully crafted with a mesmerizing view. There were a range of places to hangout apart from just the dance floor - from shaamiyanas to the pool side. It&rsquo;s one of the best places to enjoy nightlife in Goa and actually was voted as the Best Nightclub in Asia back in 2014. The crowd was great and everybody seemed to be enjoying and so were we. The lighting was super interesting and made all the neon colored objects glow in the dark. There were standard 4-5 options for drinks at the open bar and rest were reserved for the premium section. We enjoyed every bit of it from dance floor to the pool side and had our moments aweing the view (except for the premium section). We left just before it was shutting down at 4am.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>January 2016 &ndash; Goa and Scuba Diving Part II</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Next morning, scuba was at 7am, we all barely managed to reach on time lest the group would have left without us. We changed into the scuba suits and headed to the boat ride. Goa aquatics had a nice bunch of trainers &ndash; they all arranged for a mini cake on the boat when they learnt of his birthday and we had a mini cake cutting session on the boat. There were eleven of us on the boat with three instructors who made sure we feel at home and served us with tons of snacks and fruits. We had a friend also join us who is a certified scuba diver level I, making us a group of five and we requested the instructors to take all 5 us together in water. After much deliberation and difficulty, Goa aquatics agreed with the support from one scuba instructor from the other boat (1:1 ratio for diver to instructor is mandatory). Since our group was large, we were supposed to go in the end &ndash; three groups of two went ahead of us for 45 minutes each. Meanwhile we jumped in the open water with life jackets on &ndash; it was as if kids were introduced to the water the first time. Lying on your back, with open skies to look at, sun shining and the vast ocean beneath you - is a blissful feeling (and at the same time very relaxing after our night out and dirty dancing). You are not just overwhelmed with the tranquility; you dream of abandoning all your inhibitions to enjoy such moments. We played, chased each other, held on to each other, tried to swim and did all random things until it was our turn for scuba and jumped back on the boat to gear up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">People say it&rsquo;s a life changing experience (Come on, you all saw Zindagi na milegi dobara!). No, we didn&rsquo;t have a hot male instructor hence it wasn&rsquo;t the same for us girls, but there was a hot female instructor from London much to the delight of the birthday boy. Nevertheless, it was a beautiful experience. We went up to 12m, approx. 40ft where we encountered the shipwreck and aquatic life. Both me and him couldn&rsquo;t enjoy much of it &ndash; my skin had started hurting due to the sunburn (thanks to the hours of frolicking in open sea) and he started shivering at 40ft &ndash; so we both had to be pulled out of water after 30min instead of the 45min experience. However, our friends enjoyed a lot, they had the craziest time around the shipwreck (and pictures, as we could only witness that, sob sob). The visibility was extremely poor as the ocean was dirty and it was difficult to witness a lot of life in water, nevertheless the tiny fishes running around from your left, right and center just doing their business pulled us in a virtual dream. It was difficult to choose which fishy to look at. We saw some of the very rare fishes (rare for us at least) in all sorts of colors and hues. After all the hype about scuba and everything planned from the beginning we didn&rsquo;t enjoy that much. We will try again definitely, preferably outside India, for better visibility and cleaner waters. We would still recommend it to anyone looking for an adventure.</p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was just the two of us for the last day (our friends had left after scuba) and we had planned to spend it by visiting a few churches and then Thalassa. We exchanged the Thar for an Activa and had fun driving around Goa, stopping anywhere and everywhere &ndash; mostly because my hat kept flying off, while hopping from church to beach cliff, and some more beaches to a church again. And then to Thalassa!</p><br>
 <p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="../images/73/goa6.jpg"></p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Thalassa! &ndash; Vagator Beach</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thalassa is a Greek themed restaurant on Vagator beach on a mountain cliff (they also have a couple of rooms to offer) and is a must visit &ndash; it&rsquo;s a glimpse of Greece with a fascinating sunset setting. Reservations have to be made in advance &ndash; we booked about 8 hours ago and got the second last spot, special requests have to be made to sit closer to the cliff to watch the sunset (aptly called the Sunset Table). It was surreal &ndash; beautiful place with perfect drink and most importantly, with him. We were under-dressed for the place but we enjoyed nevertheless. Everything on the menu looked great but we zeroed in on Kalamata Olives and Spaghetti Napolitan coupled with glasses of Red Wine. It was a wholesome and fulfilling experience.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I was exhausted once we came back and decided to call it a night and napped for a couple of hours. He woke me up around 10pm and told me that he had planned a perfect night (a dress code this time) and chose a place with my favorite cuisine &ndash; Asian with a Teppanyanki setting! It was Koi, in Calanguate itself, a fine dining place with tons of dishes and cocktails to choose from. Koi refers to carp fish in Japanese. We settled in a mini gazebo and decided to let go of Teppanyanki this time, and ordered a la carte. I was a bit cranky as I was woken up in the middle of the sleep, however, I realized how it was the first time he had initiated and planned a date night and that made all the crankiness go away. It was an awesome romantic penultimate night in Goa. Next day, we barely managed to get breakfast and headed to the airport to catch our flight.</p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Koi &ndash; Calanguate</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Goa is usually refereed as the party destination of India even though it has loads to offer. It harbors the first and only Casino for India (although the Casino is on a ship in international waters off the coast, as Casinos aren&rsquo;t allowed in India legally). Also, famously known as Rome of the East, it was a Portuguese territory and you see a great blend of cultures &ndash; in the architecture specially if you move towards Vasco da Gama. We missed that side of Goa on this trip! That&rsquo;s another reason to come back.</p><br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We would say Goa is the place to be with friends, family but definitely with your beau. You can mold your experience for what you are looking &ndash; adventure, romance, crazy party, touristy, a foodie dive, complete chilling, a church tour or a mix of everything. Just head out and create your own unique Goa experience!</p>
