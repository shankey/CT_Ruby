            Hampi is one of the most popular tourist destination in Karnataka, and certainly one of the best for people staying in closeby cities such as Hyderabad and Bangalore. It lies within the ruins of the ancient Vijaynagar empire. It is also a UNESCO recognized World Heritage Site. Hampi would definitely capture the tourists in a special kind of magic owing not only to its historical richness but also the beaty of the entire place. Typical big boulders of the Deccan combined with the sparkling green palm and banana platations across the banks of Tungabhadra would make anyone spellbound. Hampi has many interesting stories to narrate of the royal regins through the remains of beautiful structures and monuments that once embellished the city.
